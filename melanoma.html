        <h1>Melanoma</h1>
        <p>Melanoma is a type of skin cancer that develops from the pigment-producing cells known as melanocytes. It is the most serious type of skin cancer due to its ability to spread to other parts of the body.</p>
        
        <h2>Symptoms</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>A change in an existing mole</li>
            <li>The development of a new, unusual growth on the skin</li>
            <li>Moles that are asymmetrical, have irregular borders, or vary in color</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Causes</h2>
        <p>Melanoma is primarily caused by exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun or tanning beds. Other factors include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Genetics</li>
            <li>Having a large number of moles or atypical moles</li>
            <li>Weakened immune system</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Seriousness</h2>
        <p>Melanoma can be life-threatening if not detected early. Regular skin checks and monitoring for changes in moles can help in early detection and treatment.</p>
